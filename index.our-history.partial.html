    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Fishing in San Diego may not be obvious, but it's worth coming to
      California. We've had a long way to start our company and offer our
      customers a wide range of services.

          Our owner, Steve Marston, became interested in fishing when he bought
          a ranch in California close to the water.

          Steve caught the biggest red snapper in his career so far - 13 pounds!
          This happened by pure chance near Steve's house.

          Steve started individual guided tours in San Diego, as he wanted more
          people to try fishing in these great spots.
