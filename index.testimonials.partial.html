            We had a free day in San Diego, and we decided to try something
            unusual. FishExperts is a truly worthwhile company. I liked the
            organization at the highest level, everything is clear and on
            schedule. Plus, they have very clean boats and friendly staff.

            We went fishing with the whole family (with children 4 and 6 years
            old). We all really liked it, although I'm not a big fishing fan.
            This is a combination of excursions, boat trips and fishing in
            wonderful spots. Thank you very much, FishExperts!

            I've never thought that I would like fishing so much! I had a great
            time. I especially liked that the boat is very clean, you do not
            risk getting dirty, there is almost no specific fishy smell.
            Everything is very nice and exciting even for an unprepared person.

            I bought a half-day tour as a gift for my girlfriend, she loves
            fishing. Both of us really liked it, it was a fascinating adventure.
            The guide told us a lot of interesting things about San Diego and
            the types of fish that live there. And I even caught a huge
            rock-fish!
